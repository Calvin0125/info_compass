            <title>Machine Learning Applications for Therapeutic Tasks with Genomics Data</title>
            <summary>  Thanks to the increasing availability of genomics and other biomedical data,
        many machine learning approaches have been proposed for a wide range of
        therapeutic discovery and development tasks. In this survey, we review the
        literature on machine learning applications for genomics through the lens of
        therapeutic development. We investigate the interplay among genomics,
        compounds, proteins, electronic health records (EHR), cellular images, and
        clinical texts. We identify twenty-two machine learning in genomics
        applications across the entire therapeutics pipeline, from discovering novel
        targets, personalized medicine, developing gene-editing tools all the way to
        clinical trials and post-market studies. We also pinpoint seven important
        challenges in this field with opportunities for expansion and impact. This
        survey overviews recent research at the intersection of machine learning,
        genomics, and therapeutic development.

            <title>Search and localization dynamics of the CRISPR/Cas9 system</title>
            <summary>  The CRISPR/Cas9 system acts as the prokariotic immune system and has
        important applications in gene editing. The protein Cas9 is a crucial component
        of this system. The role of Cas9 is to search for specific target sequences on
        the DNA and cleave them. In this Letter, we show that a model of facilitated
        diffusion fits data from single-molecule experiments and predicts that Cas9
        search for targets by sliding, but with a short sliding length. We then
        investigate how Cas9 explores a long DNA containing randomly placed targets. We
        solve this problem by mapping it into the theory of Anderson localization in
        condensed matter physics. Our theoretical approach rationalizes experimental
        evidences on the distribution of Cas9 molecules along the DNA.

            <title>Cyberbiosecurity: DNA Injection Attack in Synthetic Biology</title>
            <summary>  Today arbitrary synthetic DNA can be ordered online and delivered within
        several days. In order to regulate both intentional and unintentional
        generation of dangerous substances, most synthetic gene providers screen DNA
        orders. A weakness in the Screening Framework Guidance for Providers of
        Synthetic Double-Stranded DNA allows screening protocols based on this guidance
        to be circumvented using a generic obfuscation procedure inspired by early
        malware obfuscation techniques. Furthermore, accessibility and automation of
        the synthetic gene engineering workflow, combined with insufficient
        cybersecurity controls, allow malware to interfere with biological processes
        within the victim's lab, closing the loop with the possibility of an exploit
        written into a DNA molecule presented by Ney et al. in USENIX Security'17. Here
        we present an end-to-end cyberbiological attack, in which unwitting biologists
        may be tricked into generating dangerous substances within their labs.
        Consequently, despite common biosecurity assumptions, the attacker does not
        need to have physical contact with the generated substance. The most
        challenging part of the attack, decoding of the obfuscated DNA, is executed
        within living cells while using primitive biological operations commonly
        employed by biologists during in-vivo gene editing. This attack scenario
        underlines the need to harden the synthetic DNA supply chain with protections
        against cyberbiological threats. To address these threats we propose an
        improved screening protocol that takes into account in-vivo gene editing.

            <title>Host immune response driving SARS-CoV-2 evolution</title>
            <summary>  The transmission and evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome
        coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are of paramount importance to the controlling and
        combating of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Currently, near
        15,000 SARS-CoV-2 single mutations have been recorded, having a great
        ramification to the development of diagnostics, vaccines, antibody therapies,
        and drugs. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary
        characteristics and general trend. In this work, we present a comprehensive
        genotyping analysis of existing SARS-CoV-2 mutations. We reveal that host
        immune response via APOBEC and ADAR gene editing gives rise to near 65\% of
        recorded mutations. Additionally, we show that children under age five and the
        elderly may be at high risk from COVID-19 because of their overreacting to the
        viral infection. Moreover, we uncover that populations of Oceania and Africa
        react significantly more intensively to SARS-CoV-2 infection than those of
        Europe and Asia, which may explain why African Americans were shown to be at
        increased risk of dying from COVID-19, in addition to their high risk of
        getting sick from COVID-19 caused by systemic health and social inequities.
        Finally, our study indicates that for two viral genome sequences of the same
        origin, their evolution order may be determined from the ratio of mutation type
        C$&gt;$T over T$&gt;$C.

            <title>Computer-Aided Automated Detection of Gene-Controlled Social Actions of
          Drosophila</title>
            <summary>  Gene expression of social actions in Drosophilae has been attracting wide
        interest from biologists, medical scientists and psychologists. Gene-edited
        Drosophilae have been used as a test platform for experimental investigation.
        For example, Parkinson's genes can be embedded into a group of newly bred
        Drosophilae for research purpose. However, human observation of numerous tiny
        Drosophilae for a long term is an arduous work, and the dependence on human's
        acute perception is highly unreliable. As a result, an automated system of
        social action detection using machine learning has been highly demanded. In
        this study, we propose to automate the detection and classification of two
        innate aggressive actions demonstrated by Drosophilae. Robust keypoint
        detection is achieved using selective spatio-temporal interest points (sSTIP)
        which are then described using the 3D Scale Invariant Feature Transform
        (3D-SIFT) descriptors. Dimensionality reduction is performed using Spectral
        Regression Kernel Discriminant Analysis (SR-KDA) and classification is done
        using the nearest centre rule. The classification accuracy shown demonstrates
        the feasibility of the proposed system.
