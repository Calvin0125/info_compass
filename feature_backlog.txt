1. Feature test for resetting password 
2. Add feature tests for research info modal, and updating status of articles. Selenium web driver wasn't working right and I needed to move on.
3. Also add feature tests for articles/search terms, they still use JS. 
4. Use background jobs for the API calls and add a loading screen
5. Add a stats page that shows how many papers/articles were published per day over time
6. Allow users to schedule when they want news queried
7. Add email alerts
