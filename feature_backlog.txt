Misc
  1. Update tests using VCR to re-record from the API once per week.
  2. Make sure order of articles stays the same because it's annoying that it changes when you add notes. 
  3. List when navbar is expanded on small screen needs a margin
  4. Add feature tests for research info modal, and updating status of articles. Selenium web driver wasn't working right and I needed to move on.
  5. Also add feature tests for research articles/search terms, they still use JS.
