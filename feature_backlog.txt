1. Feature test for resetting password 
2. Add feature tests for research info modal, and updating status of articles. Selenium web driver wasn't working right and I needed to move on.
3. Also add feature tests for articles/search terms, they still use JS. 
4. Show university affiliation and journal reference for research papers
5. Add error handling for both APIs
6. Make it so queries stop and a notice appears when DB hits 10,000 news queries
7. Use background jobs for the API calls and add a loading screen
8. Add a stats page that shows how many papers/articles were published per day over time
9. Allow users to schedule when they want news queried
10. Add email alerts
