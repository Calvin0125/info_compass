Over the last few decades, numerous initiatives have endeavored to accelerate gender equity in academia and research society. However, despite the ongoing efforts, gaps persist across the world, and more measures need to be taken. Using social network analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning, in this study, we comprehensively analyzed gender-specific patterns in the highly interdisciplinary and evolving field of artificial intelligence for the period of 2000-2019. Our findings suggest an overall increasing rate of mixed-gender collaborations. From the observed gender-specific collaborative patterns, the existence of disciplinary homophily at both dyadic and team levels is confirmed. However, a higher preference was observed for female researchers to form homophilous collaborative links. Our core-periphery analysis indicated a significant positive association between having diverse collaboration and scientific performance and experience. We found evidence in support of expecting the rise of new female superstar researchers in the artificial intelligence field. </summary> <author> <name>Anahita Hajibabaei</name> </author> <author> <name>Andrea Schiffauerova</name> </author> <author> <name>Ashkan Ebadi</name> </author> <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom">23 pages, 10 figures</arxiv:comment> <link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01446v1" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/> <link title="pdf" href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01446v1" rel="related" type="application/pdf"/> <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom" term="cs.SI" scheme="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"/> <category term="cs.SI" scheme="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"/> </entry> <entry> <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01288v1</id> <updated>2021-06-02T16:51:45Z</updated> <published>2021-06-02T16:51:45Z</published> <title>Bottom-Up and Top-Down Neural Processing Systems Design: Neuromorphic Intelligence as the Convergence of Natural and Artificial Intelligence</title> <summary> While Moore's law has driven exponential computing power expectations, its nearing end calls for new avenues for improving the overall system performance. One of these avenues is the exploration of new alternative brain-inspired computing architectures that promise to achieve the flexibility and computational efficiency of biological neural processing systems. Within this context, neuromorphic intelligence represents a paradigm shift in computing based on the implementation of spiking neural network architectures tightly co-locating processing and memory. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the field, highlighting the different levels of granularity present in existing silicon implementations, comparing approaches that aim at replicating natural intelligence (bottom-up) versus those that aim at solving practical artificial intelligence applications (top-down), and assessing the benefits of the different circuit design styles used to achieve these goals. First, we present the analog, mixed-signal and digital circuit design styles, identifying the boundary between processing and memory through time multiplexing, in-memory computation and novel devices. Next, we highlight the key tradeoffs for each of the bottom-up and top-down approaches, survey their silicon implementations, and carry out detailed comparative analyses to extract design guidelines. Finally, we identify both necessary synergies and missing elements required to achieve a competitive advantage for neuromorphic edge computing over conventional machine-learning accelerators, and outline the key elements for a framework toward neuromorphic intelligence. </summary> <author> <name>Charlotte Frenkel</name> </author> <author> <name>David Bol</name> </author> <author> <name>Giacomo Indiveri</name> </author> <link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01288v1" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/> <link title="pdf" href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01288v1" rel="related" type="application/pdf"/> <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom" term="cs.NE" scheme="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"/> <category term="cs.NE" scheme="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"/> <category term="cs.AI" scheme="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"/> <category term="cs.ET" scheme="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"/> </entry> <entry> <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00239v1</id> <updated>2021-06-01T05:37:12Z</updated> <published>2021-06-01T05:37:12Z</published> <title>Watching Smartly from the Bottom: Intrusion Detection revamped through Programmable Networks and Artificial Intelligence</title> <summary> The advent of Programmable Data Planes represents an outstanding evolution and complete revolution of the Software- Defined Networking paradigm. The capacity to define the entire behavior of forwarding devices by controlling the packet parsing procedures and executing custom operations enables offloading functionalities traditionally performed at the control plane. A recent research line has explored the possibility of even offloading to the data plane part of Artificial Intelligence algorithms, and more specifically, Machine Learning ones, to increase their accuracy and responsiveness (by having more detailed visibility of the traffic). This introduces a significant opportunity for evolution in the critical field of Intrusion Detection. However, offloading functionalities to the data plane is not a straightforward task. In this paper, we discuss how Programmable Data Planes might complement different stages of an Intrusion Detection System based on Machine Learning. We present two use cases that make evident the feasibility of this approach and highlight aspects that must be considered when addressing the challenge of deploying solutions leveraging data-plane functionalities. </summary> <author> <name>Sergio Armando Gutiérrez</name> </author> <author> <name>John Willian Branch</name> </author> <author> <name>Luciano Paschoal Gaspary</name> </author> <author> <name>Juan Felipe Botero</name> </author> <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom">7 pages, 3 figures</arxiv:comment> <link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00239v1" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/> <link title="pdf" href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00239v1" rel="related" type="application/pdf"/> <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom" term="cs.NI" scheme="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"/> <category term="cs.NI" scheme="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"/> </entry> <entry> <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00171v1</id> <updated>2021-06-01T01:39:10Z</updated> <published>2021-06-01T01:39:10Z</published> <title>AIRIS: Artificial Intelligence Enhanced Signal Processing in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Communications</title> <summary> Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is an emerging meta-surface that can provide additional communications links through reflecting the signals, and has been recognized as a strong candidate of 6G mobile communications systems. Meanwhile, it has been recently admitted that implementing artificial intelligence (AI) into RIS communications will extensively benefit the reconfiguration capacity and enhance the robustness to complicated transmission environments. Besides the conventional model-driven approaches, AI can also deal with the existing signal processing problems in a data-driven manner via digging the inherent characteristic from the real data. Hence, AI is particularly suitable for the signal processing problems over RIS networks under unideal scenarios like modeling mismatching, insufficient resource, hardware impairment, as well as dynamical transmissions. As one of the earliest survey papers, we will introduce the merging of AI and RIS, called AIRIS, over various signal processing topics, including environmental sensing, channel acquisition, beamforming design, and resource scheduling, etc. We will also discuss the challenges of AIRIS and present some interesting future directions. </summary> <author> <name>Shun Zhang</name> </author> <author> <name>Muye Li</name> </author> <author> <name>Mengnan Jian</name> </author> <author> <name>Yajun Zhao</name> </author> <author> <name>Feifei Gao</name> </author> <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom">10 pages, 7 figures.

Also, it is well known that children tend to have difficulty learning some subjects at pre-school. We as a society focus extensively on alphabetization, but in the end, children end up having differences in another essential area: Mathematics. With this work, we create the basis for an intuitive application that could join the fact that children have a lot of ease when using such technological applications, trying to shrink the gap between a fun and enjoyable activity with something that will improve the children knowledge and ability to understand concepts when in a low age, by using a novel convolutional neural network to achieve so, named FINNger. </summary> <author> <name>Rafael Baldasso Audibert</name> </author> <author> <name>Vinicius Marinho Maschio</name> </author> <link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12281v1" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/> <link title="pdf" href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.12281v1" rel="related" type="application/pdf"/> <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom" term="cs.CV" scheme="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"/> <category term="cs.CV" scheme="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"/> </entry> <entry> <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11347v1</id> <updated>2021-05-24T15:31:24Z</updated> <published>2021-05-24T15:31:24Z</published> <title>IITP at AILA 2019: System Report for Artificial Intelligence for Legal Assistance Shared Task</title> <summary> In this article, we present a description of our systems as a part of our participation in the shared task namely Artificial Intelligence for Legal Assistance (AILA 2019). This is an integral event of Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation-2019. The outcomes of this track would be helpful for the automation of the working process of the Indian Judiciary System. The manual working procedures and documentation at any level (from lower to higher court) of the judiciary system are very complex in nature. The systems produced as a part of this track would assist the law practitioners. It would be helpful for common men too. This kind of track also opens the path of research of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the judicial domain. This track defined two problems such as Task 1: Identifying relevant prior cases for a given situation and Task 2: Identifying the most relevant statutes for a given situation. We tackled both of them. Our proposed approaches are based on BM25 and Doc2Vec. As per the results declared by the task organizers, we are in 3rd and a modest position in Task 1 and Task 2 respectively. </summary> <author> <name>Baban Gain</name> </author> <author> <name>Dibyanayan Bandyopadhyay</name> </author> <author> <name>Arkadipta De</name> </author> <author> <name>Tanik Saikh</name> </author> <author> <name>Asif Ekbal</name> </author> <link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11347v1" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/> <link title="pdf" href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11347v1" rel="related" type="application/pdf"/> <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom" term="cs.CL" scheme="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"/> <category term="cs.CL" scheme="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"/> <category term="cs.IR" scheme="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"/> </entry> <entry> <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10866v1</id> <updated>2021-05-23T06:57:25Z</updated> <published>2021-05-23T06:57:25Z</published> <title>Towards Artificial Intelligence Enabled Financial Crime Detection</title> <summary> Recently, financial institutes have been dealing with an increase in financial crimes. In this context, financial services firms started to improve their vigilance and use new technologies and approaches to identify and predict financial fraud and crime possibilities. This task is challenging as institutions need to upgrade their data and analytics capabilities to enable new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict and detect financial crimes. In this paper, we put a step towards AI-enabled financial crime detection in general and money laundering detection in particular to address this challenge. We study and analyse the recent works done in financial crime detection and present a novel model to detect money laundering cases with minimum human intervention needs. </summary> <author> <name>Zeinab Rouhollahi</name> </author> <link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10866v1" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/> <link title="pdf" href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.10866v1" rel="related" type="application/pdf"/> <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom" term="cs.LG" scheme="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"/> <category term="cs.LG" scheme="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"/> <category term="cs.IR" scheme="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"/> <category term="q-fin.ST" scheme="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"/> </entry> <entry> <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09484v1</id> <updated>2021-05-20T03:05:42Z</updated> <published>2021-05-20T03:05:42Z</published> <title>Federated Artificial Intelligence for Unified Credit Assessment</title> <summary> With the rapid adoption of Internet technologies, digital footprints have become ubiquitous and versatile to revolutionise the financial industry in digital transformation. This paper takes initiatives to investigate a new paradigm of the unified credit assessment with the use of federated artificial intelligence. We conceptualised digital human representation which consists of social, contextual, financial and technological dimensions to assess the commercial creditworthiness and social reputation of both banked and unbanked individuals. A federated artificial intelligence platform is proposed with a comprehensive set of system design for efficient and effective credit scoring.

To effectively and safely deploy these systems, their decision-making must be understandable to a wide range of stakeholders. Methods to explain AI have been proposed to answer this challenge, but a lack of theory impedes the development of systematic abstractions which are necessary for cumulative knowledge gains. We propose Bayesian Teaching as a framework for unifying explainable AI (XAI) by integrating machine learning and human learning. Bayesian Teaching formalizes explanation as a communication act of an explainer to shift the beliefs of an explainee. This formalization decomposes any XAI method into four components: (1) the inference to be explained, (2) the explanatory medium, (3) the explainee model, and (4) the explainer model. The abstraction afforded by Bayesian Teaching to decompose any XAI method elucidates the invariances among them. The decomposition of XAI systems enables modular validation, as each of the first three components listed can be tested semi-independently. This decomposition also promotes generalization through recombination of components from different XAI systems, which facilitates the generation of novel variants. These new variants need not be evaluated one by one provided that each component has been validated, leading to an exponential decrease in development time. Finally, by making the goal of explanation explicit, Bayesian Teaching helps developers to assess how suitable an XAI system is for its intended real-world use case. Thus, Bayesian Teaching provides a theoretical framework that encourages systematic, scientific investigation of XAI. </summary> <author> <name>Scott Cheng-Hsin Yang</name> </author> <author> <name>Tomas Folke</name> </author> <author> <name>Patrick Shafto</name> </author> <link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07508v1" rel="alternate" type="text/html"/> <link title="pdf" href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.07508v1" rel="related" type="application/pdf"/> <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom" term="cs.AI" scheme="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"/> <category term="cs.AI" scheme="http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom"/> </entry> <entry> <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07467v1</id> <updated>2021-05-16T16:10:32Z</updated> <published>2021-05-16T16:10:32Z</published> <title>Advances in Artificial Intelligence to Reduce Polyp Miss Rates during Colonoscopy</title> <summary> BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT: Artificial intelligence has the potential to aid gastroenterologists by reducing polyp miss detection rates during colonoscopy screening for colorectal cancer.
